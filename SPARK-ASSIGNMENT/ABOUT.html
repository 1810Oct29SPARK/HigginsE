        'Best Event Planning' was founded in 1995, by a young event planner Alisha Persaud.
        She graduated in 1990 from Mount Frederick College, located in the suburbs of Chicago.
        She has a degree in Event Planning and Fine Arts.
        Before she graduated she helped organized family events and also those that took place in her college.
        In addition she also helped friends and/or others with their parrties.
        She developed that interest at a very young age of 14, because she always witnessed her mother hosting parties/gatherings at home for the family.
        She decided that when she grew up, she would like to do that as well, and would like to make it a career.
        Her parents completely supported her with her decision, although she faced a lot of criticism from the extended family.
        In the beginning, she had to struggle a lot for work.
        Eventually five years after she graduated, she invested her savings and with the help of her father, she bought a small office space.
        With time and patience, her business thrived, and now she owns 4 other branches in Newyork, California, Texas, and Georgia in addition to the headoffice in her home city.
        She is planning to open up additional offices abroad, but that is still under consideration.
